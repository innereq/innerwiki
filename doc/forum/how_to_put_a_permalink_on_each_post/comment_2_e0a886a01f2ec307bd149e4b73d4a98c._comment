As per a comment by [[users/smcv]] at [[templates/discussion|templates/discussion]], I believe a plugin is required to provide an appropriate template variable. You would also need to define a separate templates directory for your wiki in your setup file, with a copy of`page.tmpl` to override IkiWiki's, with the correct `<TMPL_VAR foo>` added to it, to use the variable you defined in the plugin. I'm looking at doing this. â€” [[users/Jon]]
