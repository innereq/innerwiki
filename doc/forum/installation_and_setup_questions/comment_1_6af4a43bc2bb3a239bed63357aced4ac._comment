I set up a new wiki \"by hand\". https://ikiwiki.info/setup/byhand/ says: 

> Uncomment the configuration for the wrapper for your revision control system, and configure thewrapper path appropriately (for Git, it should be the path to hooks/post-update inside the bare git repository).

However, there are no commented-out wrapper configurations in the ikiwiki.setup file created by --dumpsetup, as far as I could discern.

https://ikiwiki.info/post-commit/discussion/ has an example, but it (like much else I see around here) uses Perl syntax, and so no longer applies to the yaml ikiwiki.setup, yielding the usual YAML::XS::Load Error.

So I blindly changed the =>'s to :'s, and it worked (yay!):

    wrappers: [ { wrapper: \"/my/svn/wiki/hooks/post-commit-ikiwiki\", wrappermode: \"04755\", notify: 1, } ]

If I didn't miss the real documentation for this config file setting, it would be nice to have it in the --dumpsetup file, or the post-commit page, or the rcs/details page, or somewhere. Thanks. --[[KarlBerry]
