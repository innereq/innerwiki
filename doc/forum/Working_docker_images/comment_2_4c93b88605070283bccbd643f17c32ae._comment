Here we are. I present \"Opinionated IkiWiki\" (in a box). Sources
https://github.com/jmtd/opinionated-ikiwiki
Images
https://quay.io/repository/jdowland/opinionated-ikiwiki

e.g. `docker pull docker pull quay.io/jdowland/opinionated-ikiwiki:latest`

Feedback welcome, best perhaps as GitHub issues on that GitHub project, but I'll answer questions here or in email too. â€” [[Jon]]
