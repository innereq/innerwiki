I've managed to make it work with the method described [here](https://ikiwiki.info/plugins/httpauth/).

I did not understand at first that an LDAP authentication on the webserver was enough and that ikiwiki would just trust what the webserver returns. Anyway, I replaced nginx with apache2, loaded the modules `authnz_ldap` and `ldap`, and used a configuration like this oneÂ :

```
<Location /~ikiwiki/wiki_name/auth>
        order allow,deny 
        allow from all 
        AuthName \"AuthRequired\" 
        AuthType Basic 
        AuthBasicProvider ldap 

        AuthLDAPURL \"ldap://<ldap_fqdn>:389/<searchbase>?uid?sub?<searchfilter>\" 
        AuthLDAPBindDN  \"<binddn>\" 
        AuthLDAPBindPassword \"<password>\" 
        require valid-user 
</Location>
```

As you can see I chose the second option of [the documentation](https://ikiwiki.info/plugins/httpauth/) (separate cgiauthurl), as gitlab must be able to ping the wiki without authentication (as mentioned at the end of [this doc](https://ikiwiki.info/tips/Hosting_Ikiwiki_and_master_git_repository_on_different_machines/)). Unfortunately gitlab doesn't seem to provide a way to set complex post-receive hook (the interface just provides something called \"webhooks\" which just takes an url and not a complete shell command), so I need to investigate further.
