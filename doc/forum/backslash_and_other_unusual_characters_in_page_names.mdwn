Is there a way to support backslash or other "unusual" characters in
the output .html names?

I added `\\` to wiki_file_chars (not just `\` since this value is
the contents of a Perl [...] regexp, per
IkiWiki.pm). But doing this and then creating a file \foo.mdwn on the
source side is not enough, because the backslash is autotranslated to /
(for the sake of Windows I suppose), resulting in
http://example.org//foo/.

I'm looking to make a TeX-related wiki. Hence having backslash as a
normal character is desirable. I know there would be plenty more complications,
but, just exploring the options ...

Generalizing from backslashes, is there a way to control the mapping
from .mdwn names to the output .html names (and directories I guess),
apart from the specific usedirs and indexpages settings?

I've glanced through plugins and done a bunch of web searches without
any success. Any help appreciated. Thanks. --[[KarlBerry]]
