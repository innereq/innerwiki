Sorry for any inconvenience my confusion may have spawned, but the dogs may be called off as I have decided to Move On from this patch of bad road and create a new blog from scratch. The longer I worked on the one so resistant to title-change the more I seemed to recall that I had changed its title at least once in the past, and may not have used the The Marquess of Queensberry Rules for ikiwiki title changes on those occasions. Happy Labor Day Everyone!
