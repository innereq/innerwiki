I didn't fully understand it at first, but when you do `ikiwiki --setup /etc/ikiwiki/auto.setup`, the user `foo.setup` that is generated is enough to rebuild the wiki from scratch. So from a fresh reinstall the auto.setup step can be avoided if you already have the previous `foo.setup` backed up.

So on my ansible usecase I just have to keep `foo.setup` as a template, copy it and build the wiki.

I don't know if this creates a wiki administrator though. I guess it doesn't, since the foo.setup contains no info about it.

If I really wanted to create an admin and choose its password, I guess I would have to run the `ikiwiki --setup /etc/ikiwiki/auto.setup`, and in this case the `expect` module from ansible would allow me to send the password to fill the prompt automatically (not tested). Seems kinda hacky though.
