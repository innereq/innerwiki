Some wiki pages have multiple authors.  It seems logical that you would use multiple meta directives to mark this,

```
\[[!meta author="author one"]]
\[[!meta author="other author"]]
```

however, when you do this, it appears that things that key off of the author tag only pick up on the last instance of the directive. for example a page spec looking for 

```
author(author one)
```

will not match while one looking for

```
author(other author)
```

will match.  I would expect that both would match.
