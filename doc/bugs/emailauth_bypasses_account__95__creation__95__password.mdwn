I have had the following in my `ikiwiki.setup` since 2016:

    account_creation_password: XXXXXXXXXXXX

The XXX is made of lowercase, uppercase and digits, randomly generated. I would expect this to stop any account creation. Yet new accounts get created all the time:

    w-anarcat@marcos:~/source/.ikiwiki$ perl -le 'use Storable; my $userinfo=Storable::retrieve("userdb"); print $userinfo->{$_}->{regdate} foreach keys %$userinfo'  | sort -n | tail -10
    1587487021
    1587574304
    1587695540
    1587770285
    1588354442
    1588409505
    1589257010
    1589834234
    1590175162
    1590176201

The last two timestamps, for example, are today. I'm not absolutely certain, but I believe that account is an [[plugins/emailauth]] account:

          'zemihaso_hfdsf.sadsdskfm.com' => {
                                              'regdate' => 1590175162,
                                              'passwordless' => 'd8de5ec25cfd68e64318fe6353c6428a',
                                              'subscriptions' => 'comment(blog/2020-04-27-drowning-camera)',
                                              'email' => 'zemihaso@hfdsf.sadsdskfm.com'
                                            },

It's obviously a spammer. It seems to be attacking my wiki by doing the following:

 1. register an account with emailauth
 2. subscribe to the page
 3. spam the page with a comment
 4. which then sends email to the victim(s)

It's all kind of a mess. I'm at the point in my [[todo/anti-spam_protection]] where I am seriously considering disabling all user registration and all comments on all pages. Maybe delegate this to Mastodon or some other third-party commenting system, because I'm just tired of dealing with spam and bounces...

Anyone else seeing this? Shouldn't the `account_creation_password` setting apply to emailauth? What else am I missing?

Thanks! -- [[anarcat]]
