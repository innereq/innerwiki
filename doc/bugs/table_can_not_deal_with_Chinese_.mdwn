Table directive can not deal with Chinese, when format csv

    \[[!table format=csv data="""
    a,b,c
    1,2,你好
    """
    ]]

But the below example works well.

    \[[!table format=csv data="""
    a,b,c
    1,2,3
    """
    ]]


The below example works well too

    \[[!table format=dsv delimiter=, data="""
    a,b,c
    1,2,你好
    """
    ]]

The below patch seem to deal with this problem:

I can confirm that the above patch fixes the issue for me. Thanks! I'm not an ikiwiki committer, but I would encourage them to consider the above. Whilst I'm at it, I would be *really* grateful for some input on [[todo/support_multi-row_table_headers]] which relates to the same plugin. [[Jon]]

I've hit this bug with an inline-table and 3.20190228-1 (so: patch applied), with the following definition

    [[\!table class=fullwidth_table delimiter="      " data="""    
     
    Number  Title   Own?    Read?    
    I (HB1), 70 (PB1), 5 (PB50)     Dune    O       ✓"""]]

I'm going to attempt to work around it by moving to an external CSV. ­— [[Jon]]
