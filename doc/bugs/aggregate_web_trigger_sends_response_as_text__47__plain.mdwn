With IkiWiki 3.20200202.3, [[plugins/aggregate]]'s web trigger sends it's response as HTTP 200, Content-Type: text/plain, followed by a payload that seems to include a Content-type in the body accidentally, and a bunch of HTML:


    qusp▶ GET -e "https://$redacted/ikiwiki?do=aggregate_webtrigger"
    Enter username for Git Access at REDACTED:443: admin
    Password: 
    200 OK
    Connection: close

    Aggregation triggered via web.
    
    Content-type: text/html
    
    <!DOCTYPE html>
    <html xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
    <head>
    …

Looking at the source it's fairly clear why:
<http://source.ikiwiki.branchable.com/?p=source.git;a=blob;f=IkiWiki/Plugin/aggregate.pm;hb=HEAD#l76>

I guess it was never intended for a human to see this output. I've found it useful to add a link button to some private pages to manually trigger the web hook,
something like

    <a class=feedbutton href=https://REDACTED/ikiwiki?do=aggregate_webtrigger>webtrigger</a>

So it would be nice if the payload was sent with a HTML content-type (which wouldn't hurt cron jobs or clients that ignore the body anyway)

> Oh, haha, the issue here is that the aggregation is *failing*. In the failure case, the above happens (there's an error wrapped up in HTML and delivered as text/plain).
> In the success case, the output to browser is just plain text.
