when using the [[table directive|ikiwiki/directive/table]] with the [[table plugin|plugins/table]], if I use the data argument to specify a file as a source of the data, I currently have to give a full path from the root of the wiki to the file.  I should be able to give just the file name and have the file located using the same rules that are followed when creating wiki links.
