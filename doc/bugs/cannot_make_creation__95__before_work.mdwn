I have this in my `ikiwiki.setup`:

    comments_closed_pagespec: 'creation_before(comment_forbid_before)'

I was hoping it would forbid comments on pages older than `comment_forbid_before.mdwn`. I created the page, of which you can see a rendering here:

https://anarc.at/comment_forbid_before/

Notice how ikiwiki correctly parsed the `meta` directive to make the page as created about two years ago, as I have put this on top of `comment_forbid_before.mdwn`:

    [[!meta date="2018-04-05"]]

Yet the following page, which gets mysteriously respammed all the time, keeps on getting spammed anyways:

https://anarc.at/blog/2006-07-04-vol-et-ralentissement-de-ce-blog/

I have since them removed the spam, and worked around the problem by doing this configuration instead:

    comments_closed_pagespec: 'creation_before(comment_forbid_before) or creation_year(2006)'

But later pages, "created before" the flag page, still have comments allowed:

https://anarc.at/blog/2017-07-03-free-software-activities-june-2017/

Now I know that I could list every year my blog was in operation until now in that pagespec to workaround this, but I figured it would be nicer to fix this bug.

Alternatively, it would be great to have a `creation_before(2 years ago)` or `creation_older_than(2 years)` to do what I actually want here, which is to keep spam to newer pages, to reduce the attack surface.

Thanks!
