`/usr/local/lib/ikiwiki/plugins/rst` and `/usr/local/lib/ikiwiki/plugins/proxy.py` provoke the following error output during some CGI operations if there is no python3 interpreter available

    /usr/bin/env: ‘python3’: No such file or directory

the CGI also *sporadically* dies (with signal 13, => HTTP error 500). I don't understand why this is sporadic though.

This relates to [[autosetup python warnings]] and some other bugs.

This happens even if `rst` and `proxy.py` are not active on the wiki (as they aren't, by default).

A hacky quick solution might be to rename rst rst.py and for IkiWiki to avoid scanning plugins that end in .py if they are not enabled.
