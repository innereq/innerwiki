Some people in our office edit ikiwiki via command line, and others via the Web interface. At a certain point, the following error popped up in Apache error logs:

It looks like commits via the Web interface continued to appear to work mostly as normal, but weren't being commited in the public facing git repo that contains the `.ikiwiki/` directory. I did notice a page that I edited contained ">>>>>" text, but not "====.." or "<<<<.." text in the Web version, but not in my git checkout (from the master git repo). Also some people reported problems with the Web interface after the fact.

When I went in to fix the repo, I quickly removed those uncommitted changes, but that was clearly a mistake, because I lost the edits that had been created via the Web after a certain point in time.

We're using ikiwiki version 3.20160121 on Trisquel 8, which is based on Ubuntu 16.04.

If you have any thoughts about what caused this issue, I'd be happy to hear it. At this point, we've mostly moved on from the data loss.

Thanks! : )
