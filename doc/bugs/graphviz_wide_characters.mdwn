If you include a wide character, such as a fancy quote, in a [[graphviz|plugins/graphviz]] source file for use with the file parameter to the graph directive, you get the following error:

```
[[!graph Error: Wide character in subroutine entry at /usr/share/perl5/IkiWiki/Plugin/graphviz.pm line 57.]]
```

Note, this is what renders on the resulting wiki page, not something that you see on the command line. 
Since dot supports UTF-8, I would expect this to work.  

I'm unsure if this is a bug in the graphviz plugin, or in the perl module it depends upon, but since the graphviz pugin seems to be perl5â€½ I figured I would start by reporting the problem here, on the assumption that the older perl was less likely to handle UTF-8.
