Is it perhaps time to flip the default for the `html5` to `1`? What criteria should be used to answer that question?
With [[smcv]]'s last major change in this area, back in 2014, the market share of IE8 and earlier was a concern at
5%. What is the equivalent market share today?

The templates are still a real complex mess of branches around this configuration option. I'd love to see all that
branching removed. Would anyone else? A hypothetical future html4 option/plugin could work by post-processing the
generated output and replacing the troublesome tag names (via XSLT perhaps, depending on tooling). Is there any
appetite for this?
