[[Tina]] has an updated [[plugins/osm]] that fixes some basic usages,
greatly simplifies the code, and would let us close
[[replace openlayers with leaflet]]
and
[[bugs/osm plugin fails to display map with javascript error]],
at the cost of removing some features.

The branch already incorporates changes from my review and additional fixes.
I'd appreciate additional careful review from another maintainer,
including about the points raised at [[plugins/osm/discussion]].

It has been over 2 years since I created this patch... I have even changed my name and gender in the meantime :)
Any chances of it being merged into master? At this point I am considering if it makes sense to keep using ikiwiki if I have to keep maintaining local patches for years.
