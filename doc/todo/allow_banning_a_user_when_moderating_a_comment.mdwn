If a logged-in user is both a comment moderator and an admin, it would be nice if you could tick a box to ban the poster of a comment (or their IP if not signed in. Or their IP, AND their login if signed in, I suppose.) via the comment moderation interface.  Presently, you must view the back-end files to establish who posted the comment (the IP is not exposed in the moderation interface yet.) â€” [[Jon]]

> +1, FWIW. in my experience, banning a bunch of IPs did help with the spambots for some time. In [[todo/anti-spam_protection]] i implemented some measures to implement this banning "out of band" but i have mostly given up on that now. all comments are moderated a priori and i just get a nightly email warning me when new spam comes in. the advantage of that approach is the spam never reaches the production site (1) and (2) i can ignore spammers until real content comes in at which point i can just flush it all out. -- [[anarcat]]
