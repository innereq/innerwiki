Hey

Not sure if this is the right place, but [[todo/admonitions]] didn't feel right, so here we go.

I just upgraded my home server (which is where i'm running ikiwiki) to bullseye, and had to rebase everything onto `3.20200202.3-1`. So you should be able to get all those branches, again rebased on that tag, on my git repo: https://gitlab.com/anarcat/ikiwiki.git. The `deploy` branch has all those branches merged, and the `master` branch is the branch point, basically `3.20200202.3-1`.

I hope that will help you sort through my patches! :) -- [[anarcat]] 2021-10-05
